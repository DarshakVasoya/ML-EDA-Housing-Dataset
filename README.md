Exploring, Visualizing and analysis for housing database, these tasks are being done 
in the report. Pandas for data transformation, NumPy for data calculation, matplotlib 
and seaborn for visualizing data, skillsnetwork for download dataset, SciPy for 
implementing statistics methods on dataset, these python libraries are going to be 
used. First, exploring different variables and their types and seeing how different 
variables correlate with each other. Second, removing duplicate value, handling 
missing value, finding Outliers and transforming categorical variables into dummies 
for further computation will be done. At the end, we will check hypotheses by chisquare test and t-test.
